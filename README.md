This repository contains a school project for the module "Atelier GÃ©nie Logiciel" (Software Engineering Workshop) in C#. The main branch includes a comprehensive calculator program that handles all specified cases as required by the assignment instructions.

Additionally, there is a second branch containing a form based on specific guidelines provided during the course.

I initially developed this project using my academic account in a classroom setting. However, due to privacy settings, I have uploaded it to my personal account for easier access and sharing.
